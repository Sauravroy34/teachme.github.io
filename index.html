    <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
    <p>
    Linear algebra is study of function and expression which has linear relationship with its dependent variable
    or in simpler words Linear algebra is the study of linear combinations. It is the study of vector spaces, lines and planes, and some mappings that are required to perform the linear transformations.
    before we dive into linear algebra lets first understand function and equation
    </p>
    <h3>function</h3>
    <p>
    Think of function as some kind of machine that takes an input perform some operation and spits out an output for example a coffee grinder machine it take coffee as an input perform some operation(here it might be grinding beans into smaller fine particales) and returning an output(coffee powder)
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    here it we gave coffee and we got coffee powder now in context of mathematics suppose i have a function 
    
    f(x) = 2x 
    this simple function takes x as an input(which can be thought of a independent variable) performs some operation (multiplying the vairable by 2) and giving the output vairable(which will be called dependent vairable since its value is dependent on x)
    if we dive more in the world of mathematics and define function pure mathematically
    
    it would be mappings of one set (set is an ordered pair of things) to another set think of mapping as imposing some sort of plociy for example mapping in the previous example might be that we take a number(x) and return another number (2x)
    </p>
    <p>
    we use we use function to genralise some event for example we use function force = ma makes our life easier for calculating force (there is a reason why its called formula)function to genralise some event for example we use function force = ma makes our life easier for calculating force (there is a reason why its called formula) based on various enviorments 
    
    defination of function in context of computer science would some blueprint which lays down the plan on how to use the material (might be how to lay down bricks and stones to build a house) provided (or not provided) to give some output or do some work 
    
    now lets talk about dimesions</p>
    <img src = "linear_algebra/function-in-math.png">
    <h3>dimesions</h3>
    <p>
    dimesions is the number of vairable in a function mathematically it is number of independent vairable in a function 
    </p>
    
    <h3> vector</h3> 
    <p>
    since we know what is a function lets talk about visulazing a function to visulise a function we have few methods but the we use function to genralise some event for example we use function force = ma makes our life easier for calculating force (there is a reason why its called formula)most used method is called "graph" graph is displaying the relationship between the dependent and independent variable
    if i have a function f(x) = x + 2
    
    just like we said
    graph would look like a straight line this line shows that the linear relationship between input and output.vector is one another way of representing points in catersian form(normal graph one) if a point (a,b) was to be expressed in vector form it would be a(i) + b(j) a and be would be the distance of the point from the respective axes in a nutshell vector is something which has magnitude and direction(here the direction would from the origin to the point) and the magnitude is the length of the vector(distance from origin)

    number of numbers in a vector repsents its dimension
    in computer science vectors are a fancy word for a list of 1d numbers
    
    </p>

<h3>operation on vectors</h3>

we can add vectors and subtract vector both happen element wise which result in a new vector which is just a linear combination of vectors 

multiplication of vector are of two first the dot product(multiply each element and just add it up) it has some geometrical meaning in physics and differnt meaning in computeer science(it is used as a proxy for when we required to multply to array elementwise and just sum it up like weights in neural network) 

vector multiplication or cross product is tool used to give a vector perpendicular to original one 

<h3>basis of a space</h3>

think of basis as some sort of language system if want ice cream in english i would say "give that ice cream over there" in hindi it would be "mujhae ice cream dae do" we mean the same thing but our way of expressing it is very differnt same goes to basis of a space (a higher dimension) in short basis of system can be set linearly inependent set of vectors because these in their set no vectors can be made by combinnig other vectors linearly  

<h3>matrix</h3> 
matricess are orderd things in rows colowns you can matrix of numbers a matrix of things (a good example of this defination would be like sitting arrangement of class room ) each element of a matrices has its own address (m th row n th colown)                                         
just like a classroom has rows and colowns matrix has its own operations like addition,subtraction and multiplication
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>linear transformation</h3> 
        I like to think about linear transformation as your transforming or changing the whole (i.e cartesian plane and seeing how your function changes its position and shape) its just a function which takes a oint and return a new ponint ("for greater visulazation watch 3blue1brown video on that matter)
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Where do i and j hat land</h3>
Transformation can veiwed in matrix form as a matrix where each colown tells where i and j hat land these matrix are then multipled by the function and we get the transformation
transformation = AX (A is the function input vector X is the defined transformation)
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Eigen vector and eigen values</h3> 

    During linear transformation vectors change their orentation however some vectors have change only in their length and those vectors are called eigon vector of the transformation and the value they get scaled with are called eigon values these concept hold their importance in image transformation and principale component analysis 
    AX = PX (P is the eigon value x is eigon vector)
