    <h1>Machine Learning Basics</h1>
    <h3>Ml basisc</h3>
    If ml was to be summarised in a single line it would making predictions or genrating with the help of mathematics the core idea of ml is simple its just maths its amazing that how maths can be used to automate things.Its very inutive to think of machine learing as to explainig or trainig a very hardworking and honest child and making him/her be able to learn something.Now lets dive into the paradigms of ml and some basic concepts
    
    <h3>Ml types</h3>
    mainly there are three types of ml training techniques supervised Learning,unsupervised and reinforcement Learning
    <br>
    supervised Learning-> it is a type of learnig where we specify the output(answer) think of this as teacher who tries to teach children with examples for example lets assume the teacher wants to teach simple additon to children in order to do so he tries to teach them via examples like he comes to class and writes some sums (2+2(feature) =4(labels)) and then expects students to find pattern and genralise to other number he tries to provide enough example so students have some idea whats going on. after seeing example students tries to do the sum on their on own while referring the examples and they give a answer if their answer are wring they try to find out where they went wrong and tries to correct their approach they do it for tens and thousand of time.teacher can have control(hyperparameters) over how many examples they provide and their teaching style while its students task to learn an genralise and correct their error in the end teacher takes test(validation) and find out who have learned the pattern(optimal) vs who have memorised (overfitting) just the ansewer vs who has still dindt understand(underfitting)
